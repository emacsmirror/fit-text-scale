** Keybindings
Keybindings could be set as

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

; key bindings
(global-set-key
 (kbd "C-x C-&")
 (lambda (&optional arg)
   (interactive "P")
   (apply
    (if arg
        #'fts-max-font-size-see-line
      #'fts-max-font-size-see-lines)
    nil)))

(global-set-key
 (kbd "C-x C-*")
 (lambda (&optional arg)
   (interactive "P")
   (fts-max-font-size-see-buffer)))
#+end_src

With these settings

- C-x C-& binds to ~fts-max-font-size-see-lines~.
- C-u C-x C-& binds to ~fts-max-font-size-see-line~.
- C-x C-* binds to ~fts-max-font-size-see-buffer~.

Also recall the bindings for text scale { C-x C-+ } { C-x C-- } { C-x
C-0 }.
